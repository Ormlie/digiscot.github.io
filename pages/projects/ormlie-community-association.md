## Project plan

### Project description

IT access to help those without IT knowledge or equipment access the internet and online services.  It also develops individuals' IT skills in order to help participants gain basic digital skills, and become independent in their use of IT.


## Project milestones - Net Axs (Wick)

### Phase 1  Feb - April 2015

We have employed two part-time members of staff to help individuals engaging with the project to access IT and to help them gain further IT skills.

We opened on the 9th February, and have marketed the facility through the Job Centre, Skills Development Scotland, Highland Council etc. to advise that the facility is open from the Wick Citizens Advice Bureau on a Monday and Friday 10.00am - 2.00pm.  We have also ordered cards and leaflets promoting Net Axs in Wick

Those attending register with us and then each time they use the facility they sign in on our sign in sheets.  Our staff take a short note of why the individual has used the facility each day.

In Phase 1 we said we would attract 10 individuals to the project - in fact we have attracted 15.  We didn't anticipate delivering computer training in this phase, however we have given computer help and tutoring to 7 individuals to help them improve their computing skills.    

### Phase 2  May 2015 - July 2015

By the end of phase two we said we would have 23 individuals enrolled on the project - we have 24 individuals enrolled.  We had said we would start to help 7 individuals improve their computing skills in this phase - we reached that target in phase 1 and have continued to work with those individuals.

With our partners in the Citizens Advice Bureau we have identified a need for both ESOL and adult basic education training, alongside IT support and training.  Highlife Highland have offered to supply a tutor on Fridays to help and we will actively refer individuals attending our project.  Highlife Highland have currently agreed to supply an individual to deliver this training over an 8 week period after which it will be reviewed.
